Request from Bulj for a bucket of 'water' poured over someone's head.

First version. I had to record this outside - so there might be a little outdoor ambi.

Plastic hobby horse stood in for the victim. Water poured from plastic bucket... I didn't realize until after I transferred it, that the horse rocked a bit after dowsing, whoever uses this sample ought to cover the sound with the utter shock and flailing body of the victim.

Recorded with a Sony ECM-99 stereo microphone to SonyMD.
