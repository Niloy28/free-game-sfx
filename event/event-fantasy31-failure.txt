While perusing Freesound for a nice and dramatic sound or two of failures, all the ones I've seen were pretty wimpy, so-to-speak. So I decided to create a few failure samples on a music-making program called Musescore. These are for big whopper failures and are very dramatic - they may also be used for a scary event in a film or play. For this project I used violins, violas, cellos, double basses, timpani, cymbals and brass. Enjoy!
