These are a few sounds from my UI & Item Sound Effect Jingls which I've released in the Unity Asset Store.

Feel free to use these as you will. 

You can find the Asset Store link here.

There, you will find a collection of 30 bright musical sound effects. You'd normally find these in things like puzzle games and colorful platformers. 
I've set them up so that there are ten main sound effects with multiple variations for each. so that you can mix and match them how you please.

Thanks and enjoy.
