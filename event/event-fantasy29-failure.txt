This is a version of a previous file I created (https://freesound.org/people/FunWithSound/sounds/394897/)that includes a gong at the end to make it more dramatic. The link to the gong sound is here: https://freesound.org/people/Veiler/sounds/209917/. It would be really nice of you to credit the user "Veiler" for their awesome gong sound, and maybe me for making the failure sound. But not obligations. :-)

While perusing Freesound for a nice and dramatic sound or two of failures, all the ones I've seen were pretty wimpy, so-to-speak. So I decided to create a few failure samples on a music-making program called Musescore. These are for big whopper failures (or "epic failures") and are very dramatic - they may also be used for a scary event in a film or play. It includes a short buildup and a loud dissonant chord at the end to create suspense and horror. For this project I used violins, violas, cellos, double basses, timpani, cymbals and brass. Enjoy!
