A seamless heavenly / dreamy sound loop. While it is a short loop, it seems to hold up quite well against repetition and would be suitable to use for about 1 to 2 minutes. Could work on a title screen, a menu, a cutscene or something. It's very ambient and doesn't try to draw too much attention but rather set the mood.

It was made using only ZynAddSubFX in LMMS.
