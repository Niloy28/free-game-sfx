A destructive sound created by piecing together all of the sounds in my "Wooden Fence Sounds" pack for an explosive effect. Feel free to have a go at creating one yourself with any other sounds you can find or record!

If any of these sounds have been of help, and you are feeling charitable, please do consider donating to Freesound to help keep the site running (a link is also on the home page). Any donations are greatly appreciated! And for similar sounds, do please check out the full library I created.

Please comment on where you intend to use the sound, and feel free to post a link to the work where you used it if you want (I enjoy watching/listening to anything you create!)

You don't have to worry about crediting this sound if you are using it for non-commercial projects unless you want to (e.g. educational or non-profit activities), but if you use the sound for a commercial project you must credit the sound. If you would prefer to not have to give attribution for commercial projects, then take a look at the attribution-free license.

An example of how you might credit is by putting this in the description/credits:
