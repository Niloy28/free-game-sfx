Taken from open source release of Dink Smallwood, which has Wesnoth sounds edited to match real-time nature of the game.

  Sword hitting something non-metallic, but also used at high rate
  (22050Hz) to produce the 'Dink picks a small heart' sound

  Edited: added kind of a reversed and shortened echo after the
  hitting sound.  Sounds ok played faster as a 'pick-something-up'
  sound too. I'm not fully satisfied with this, but I did my best :).

  Edited: I made this sound earlier, but it started to annoy me, so I
  modified the "echo" part to be a little bit "crunchier".
