These are 4 foot steps each of someone wearing leather, cloth and armor 12. 

They are very quick and very subtle but played in session They should go together to make a collective sound.  

 The noise floor, is pretty low, so they should be fine when turned up or compressed.  They are soft in gain in order to not bring too much attention to them.
