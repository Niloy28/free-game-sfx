This is a sound effect of a plant being grabbed and pulled up out of the ground. It's really quiet (and you may need to be amplified, depending on what you're using it for). It also has some snapping sound from the roots being pulled from the ground.

Have fun! ;)

P.S. I request that all my sound effects only be used for clean, appropriate media and projects. Thanks!
