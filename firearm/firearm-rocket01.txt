"Warzone 2100, released in 1999 and developed by Pumpkin Studios, was a ground-breaking and innovative 3D real-time strategy game.

In 2004 Eidos, in collaboration with Pumpkin Studios, decided to release the source for the game under the terms of the GNU GPL, including everything but the music and in-game video sequences, which were released later."


Note that most of Warzone 2010 sfx files (especially electricity) probably come from Sound Ideas and were relicensed under GPL2 illegally. Use at your own risk.
