SFX suitable for vintage Sci Fi stuff.

All based on frequency modulation.

The package includes the following files:

    activate_1.wav
    alarm_1.wav
    complain_1.wav
    creature_1.wav
    creature_2.wav
    creature_3.wav
    creature_4.wav
    danger.wav
    demonic_1.wav
    flight_1.wav
    flight_maneuver_1.wav
    flight_maneuver_2.wav (forgot to put this one in the preview file, but it is in the pack)
    health_1.wav
    laser_gun_1.wav
    laser_gun_2.wav
    magnetic_field_1.wav
    magnetic_field_2.wav

The file sprite.wav contains all the sounds concatenated together for convenience.

Cheers.
