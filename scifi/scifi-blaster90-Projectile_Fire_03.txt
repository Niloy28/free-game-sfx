"Hello! My name is Timothy Adan. I am a composer and sound designer for games.

When I can, I will be uploading libraries of sounds here that folks can use as they would like. Primarily sound effects, but there will be the occasional music cue uploaded as well.


If you have any questions, comments, or suggestions, or you just want to say "hi" feel free to email me, or message me on twitter at any time. I'd love to hear from you!


-Tim"


During the 2018 Global Game Jam, I worked on four different games, creating all kinds of different audio for our "transmission" theme. 


This bundle is the culmination of all of the sounds I have recorded or created for each of those four games.


Enjoy!
