Raw detailed audio of a fart. Originally recorded at 384khz/32-bit and arranged for 5.1 surround, this rare piece of flatulence has a swift attack with minimal sustain, followed by a quick decay of the utmost precision. It's aesthetic is predominantly veering towards a watery, squishy sound - evidently with a low viscosity - and the natural reverberation celebrates the opening of a Â£10,000 studio that was set up to capture this monumental event. The recorder was held a few centimeters from ground zero (no damage was sustained during the operation).

Okay, I had diarrhea, might as well get something useful out of it...
