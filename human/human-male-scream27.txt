Thijs screams very loud, torture sounds.

Male_Thijs_loud_scream

History of the sample
The sample, male_thijs_loud_scream was recorded back in the days Than van Nispen t.P. studied biology in Utrecht, The Netherlands, and in his free time participated in projects where sound-fx or film-music were needed.
The sample was recorded late 2001 in his student-apartment for some special effects for an interactive theatre play in which Than helped with sound-fx and foley for short animations...
This time a lot of screams were needed as special effect sounds for some fake 'torturing' device within the play.
Thijs, a friend of Than's, showed the person who was doing some voice over screaming sessions, 'how to do it'.
So... that's why there's currently only 'one' Thijs-sample in my collection...
Apparently it turned out to be sort of an unique and 'lucky' shot!
The sample was recorded at 44.1 KHz with a Shure SM58 microphone and with a Terratec EWS 88 MT sound-card.

When Than learned to know the freesound project he thought that maybe other people could also use this sample and other scream-samples in their work or projects and so finally it ended up in the movie 'Children of Men' and many other movies and games...
