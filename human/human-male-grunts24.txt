I'm not really satisfied with this, but maybe it still will come in handy for someone :)

You can use this sounds for a variety of projects, from FPS, to Sidescroller, to RPG.
The archive includes the sounds both as ogg and mp3.

I uploaded the Audacity source files, in case you want to mess around with them.
