I was recording some cloth foley when, all of a sudden, a sickening burp emerged straight into the microphone. I think you could also use this sound as part of someone puking. Recorded with an AKG C414 in hyper-cardioid mode through a Scarlett 6i6 into Pro Tools 10.

If you use this sound let me know as I'm curious to see what kind of uses it has.
