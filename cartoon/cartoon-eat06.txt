"Goldie" the wild boar eat some nuts. Well, ther is a highway nearby and a lot of pedestrians with bikes and dogs and so on. Should repeat this on a sunday morning to get a clear sound of Goldie.

Recorded with a Zomm H2 on 90degree, 2 meters away from Goldie... I lowered the peaks to get a better normalization of the whole atmosphere.

Goldie lives in the alluvial forrest in Leipzig, mostly seperated.
