LabChirp, sfxr/bfxr and Musagi are nice programs for sythesizing sound effects out of several channels with sine waves, white noise and envelopes over them. Photosounder can be used to turn any image into sound effect, taking it as spectral moulding shape. SpectraLayers Pro has similar spectral moulding cpabilities, and also allows drawing spectrum, like an image in Photoshop.

If you have some effect that you want to make loopable, then cut it in the middle, swap two resulting samples and crossfade them.

Typical of producing unusual sounds is mixing several pitch-shifted versions of the same sample. That way you can get robotic or monster sounding voice out of human one. For example, to produce satanic sounding voice, record normally, then reverse and pitch-shift down by 50%

Audacity's "Effect -> Sliding Time Scale/Pitch Shift" produces awesome effects from existing audio files.

Heavy reverb could be used too.

Audacity's Vocoder could be used to generate specific sci-fi/magic effects from input files. Try following presents

Distance=60, Bands=40, Original audio=0, White noise=0, Radar needles=100, Radar needles (Hz)=80
That will produce scifi robotic sounding effects.

Distance=60, Bands=40, Original audio=0, White noise=100, Radar needles=0, Radar needles (Hz)=80
That will produce more magical sound effects


Fat electrical discharge/tesla-coil sounds could be produced using basic electric sounds (like welding and jacob ladders) with some delay processing and flanger.
