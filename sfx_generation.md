Typical way to produce unusual sound is to mix several pitch-shifted versions of the same sample.

Audacity's "Effect -> Sliding Time Scale/Pitch Shift" produces awesome effects from existing audio files.

Heavy reverb could be used too.

Audacity's Vocoder could be used to generate specific sci-fi/magic effects from input files. Try following presents

Distance=60, Bands=40, Original audio=0, White noise=0, Radar needles=100, Radar needles (Hz)=80
That will produce scifi robotic sounding effects.

Distance=60, Bands=40, Original audio=0, White noise=100, Radar needles=0, Radar needles (Hz)=80
That will produce more magical sound effects
