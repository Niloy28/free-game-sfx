A large freight train passes from left to right. There is quite a lot of dynamic range, particularly at the beginning, so turn it up for best results. There are several screeches and metallic scrape and other large train sounds.
Recorded with a pair of AT4021 mics into a modified Marantz PMD661 and edited with Reason.
