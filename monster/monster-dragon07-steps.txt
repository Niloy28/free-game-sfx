In an attempt to re-create the sound of the mighty trex stalking around in Jurassic Park, I made this. Listening to the original, I always noticed that it sounded a bit like a tree falling to the ground. That was one of the elements I used and the rest was me stomping around on various types of terrain. Please let me know how you like it.
