Raw audio of scraping a wet polystyrene bodyboard with my hands. Then processed and edited with a pitch shifter in Cubase to sound like a creature. Part of a sound library that creates vocalization sounds using only a bodyboard. Feel free to check out the full library here.

If any of these sounds have been of help, and you are feeling charitable, please do consider donating to Freesound to help keep the site running (a link is also on the home page). Any donations are greatly appreciated! And for more awesome sounds, do please check out my sound libraries.

Please comment on where you intend to use the sound, and feel free to post a link to the work where you used it if you want (I enjoy watching/listening to anything you create!)

You don't have to worry about crediting this sound if you are using it for non-commercial projects unless you want to (e.g. educational or non-profit activities), but if you use the sound for a commercial project you must credit the sound. If you would prefer to not have to give attribution for commercial projects, then take a look at the attribution-free license.

An example of how you might credit is by putting this in the description/credits:
"Creature Voice, A5, Dry.wav" by InspectorJ of Freesound.org

The sound was recorded using a "H1 Zoom recorder" and edited in Cubase.

Originally recorded on 16th August 2017.

Note: Audio quality is always better when downloaded.
