Monster sounds made with Lips of Suna ( http://lipsofsuna.org/wiki/audio-tasks ) in mind.

Attack/damage based on http://www.freesound.org/people/qubodup/sounds/200279/ by myself.

Idle recorded with Zoom H2 with computer fan in the background, but should be played back at low volume in games.

FLAC, 5 files, mono, 48000Hz, 24bit(! - 16 might be required for most software to play this)

2013-09-19 Update: OGG Vorbis (48000Hz) also included.
