Produced from scratch, trying to recreate CONE3.WAV from Hexen video game.

Here is how to create sounds such as that one:

1. Using SpectraLayers Pro 3.0.17, create 1.4 seconds long empty file.
2. Use Noise Spray tool to hand-drawn spectrum shape, similar to the one in CONE3. Instead of white noise, you can load pre-made sample, that sounds promising, then apply exposure and erasure to it, so it will take shape looking like CONE3 or other sound you're trying to re-create.
3. Save said file.
4. Opened it in Audacity
5. Apply envelope to achieve required volume shape.
6. Apply Wahwah effect, using LFO Freq = 0.5, LFO Start Phase = 0.0, Depth=50%, Resonance=2.5, Wah Freq=30, Output Gain=-6.0
7. Normalize
8. Now copy result to separate track and apply Vocoder effect to it with following params: Vocoder, with distance=60, Number of bands=40, original audio=0, white noise=100, Radar needles=0, radar needles freq=0. That should produce more magical cold-sound texture.
9. Mix result with vocoded copy, moved slightly to the right, producing magical sounding attack build-up.
10. Optionally add Reverb, Delay and Chorus.

Result should sound similar to Hexen one.
