A simple sound effect for use where a slow, dramatic ignition of flame is needed, but as always can be used more creatively. A welding type striker is heard at the beginning, however if need be I can remove this for you. This sound was made by slowing down the lighting of an acetylene torch and adding a bit of reverb for emphasis. Normalized to -.1 dB. Minimal compression and limiting.

If you use my sounds feel free to send me a link! I love to see/hear what people create with my sounds! Enjoy!
