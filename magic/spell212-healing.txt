Sorry the files arent just one sound. Its the same sound done more than a couple times at different durations so you can choose how long you want the spell sound or how short.
 

I posted in the preview in order of what I was going for
1. Healing (3 times
2. Teleport (3 times
3. Electrical/Spell 2 diff types

If you would like me to upload more spell sounds and have some in mind. PLease leave a comment telling me so I can do so.
